Survey Tool

A Python Django application to do Experience Sampling Method (ESM) surveys.

This application is a front-end for the Funnel survey tool and the Twilio
phone-sms service that enables users to send surveys via SMS and collect
the data into a spreadsheet via Funnel.

ESM surveys are often used to study peoples' mental states. 

Mihály Csíkszentmihályi used ESM surveys to formulate his idea of the flow
mental state.
